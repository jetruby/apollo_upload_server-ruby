# ApolloUploadServer

Middleware which allows you to upload files using [graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby), [apollo-upload-client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client) and Ruby on Rails.

Note: this implementation uses [v2 of the GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec/tree/v2.0.0-alpha.2), so you should use apollo-upload-client library >= v7.0.0-alpha.3. If you need support for [v1 of the GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec/tree/v1.0.0), you must
use [version 1.0.0](https://github.com/jetruby/apollo_upload_server-ruby/tree/1.0.0) of this gem.
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'apollo_upload_server'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install apollo_upload_server

Middleware will be used automatically.

Gem adds custom `Upload` type to your GraphQL types.
Use `ApolloUploadServer::Upload` type for your file as input field:
```ruby
  input_field :file, ApolloUploadServer::Upload
```

That's all folks!
